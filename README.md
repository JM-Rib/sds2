# Erasmus+ SDS2 project 

This project aims to implement a Planning Poker as a web application.
The planning poker application will allow multiple users to hold a Planning Poker session online. Planning Poker, also called “Scrum Poker,” is a consensus-based Agile planning technique used to assess product backlogs, guessing how much time and effort is needed to complete each of the backlog's initiatives. 


## Roles and responsibilities 
The role and responsibilties of each member of the team are described as follows:
- Lucas (Product Owner, developer) is responsible for: 
 - creating the Product Backlog

- Ivan (Scrum Master, developer) is responsible for:

- Jean-Marin, Paula (developers) are responsible for:
