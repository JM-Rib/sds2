# Erasmus+ SDS2 project 

This project aims to implement a Planning Poker as a web application. The planning poker application will allow multiple users to hold a Planning Poker session online. 

## About planning poker
Planning Poker is a collaborative estimation technique used in Agile development to help teams assess the effort or complexity of tasks or user stories. Each team member is given a set of cards with numbers (often following the Fibonacci sequence) representing different levels of effort. In this case the online cards will display the following options: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 and 21. The process begins with the product owner provides a short overview of one user story to be estimated. After a brief discussion, everyone privately selects a card to estimate the effort required. Once all cards are revealed, any discrepancies are discussed, and team members share their reasoning. If needed, the team can repeat the voting until a consensus is reached. This ensures all perspectives are considered and helps the team arrive at a more accurate, collective estimate. This technique encourages open communication and  helps teams make better-informed decisions about how much work can realistically be completed in a given sprint or iteration.

## Roles and responsibilities 
The role and responsibilties of each member of the team are described as follows:
- Lucas as product owner and developer will handle defining the product backolog, managing it and prioritizing the tasks, to ensure stakeholders needs are met. And also implement features, develop code, and self-manage their work to meet sprint goals. Balancing both roles to deliver high-quality increments and participating in Scrum events to ensure continuous progress and alignment.

- Ivan as scrum master and developer will facilitate Scrum events (like sprint planning, daily meetings, sprint reviews, and retrospectives), help remove impediments, and promote communication while contributing to building the product. Will also develop code, test the product to make sure its working, and collaborate with team members to deliver increments. 

- Jean-Marin and Paula as developers will be responsible for writing, testing, and maintaining the project according to the requirements outlined in the product backlog. Collaborate with the Scrum team during sprint planning, daily standups, and sprint reviews to ensure progress and align with the sprint goals. Work together and communicate with all the team members, including the Scrum Master and Product Owner, to deliver high-quality, working software at the end of each sprint. They also contribute to continuous improvement by participating in retrospectives and providing feedback on processes.

## Communication strategies 
We will comunicate both in person and online (Zoom meetings) with regular sprint reviews and retrospectives to ensure alignment with stakeholders and continuous improvement. Clear and concise documentation, like product backlogs and sprint goals, will help keep everyone up to date also. We will aim for opem communication and collaboration to ensure that all team members and stakeholders are always informed. By maintaining frequent and effective communication the teams can stay agile and adaptive throughout the project.
